# ECODash
An interactive dashboard coded purely in Python, utilizing Plotly's interactive graphs and deployed as a web app using Dash

Makes use of data from OECD: https://www.oecd.org/switzerland/, taking into consideration the following socio-economic indicators:

- Inflation
- Poverty
- Unemployment
- GNI (Gross National Income)
- Household Wealth
- Imports
- Exports
- Life Expectancy
- Fertility Rates
- Native Women Unemployment
- Native Men Unemployment
- Nominal House Prices (meaning: nominal house prices for purchasing, not adjusted for inflation)
- Nominal Rent Prices
- Household Savings
- Population

The dashboard is designed to cater towards countries under Europe, notable examples being Austria, Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy and many more. It makes use of Plotly's graphical visualizations to compare across different indicators, and derive answers to certain research questions, few of which are highlighted below:

Q1. 
## Demo of the First Dashboard

- Two dropdowns have been implemented in the dash, one is for selecting the country ( all of which belong to the European continent), and second is for a more fine-grained analysis including the Year ( we have data from around 10 years to track evolution across different socio and economic indicators).
